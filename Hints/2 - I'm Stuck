Here's one of the state setting functions from later on in the code:
     
                 setCurrentCalc(prevCalc => ({
        			    currentNum: [],
        			    previousNum: prevCalc.currentNum,
        			    operation: opFromClick,
        			    result: []
        		    }))
                                     
In other words, this is saying update the currentCalc state as follows: 
            
                a. The value of currentNum should be an empty array. 
                
                b. The value of previousNum should be the value of the currentNum of the previous 
                   version of the state. 
                
                c. The value of operation should be opFromClick (a variable defined near the top of 
                   the handleClick function).
                
                d. The value of result should be an empty array.
    
Here's another example: 

                setCurrentCalc(prevCalc => ({
        			    ...prevCalc,
        			    operation: opFromClick
        		}))
                
This is saying update the currentCalc state as follows:   
                
                a. "operation" should have the value opFromClick. 
                
                b. all of the properties from the previous state should be preserved. 

You can use these examples as analogies for writing your code for the tasks, although you will have to make adjustments to follow the instructions.
