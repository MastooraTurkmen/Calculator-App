# REACT PROJECT

Warning: Vite enforces using jsx syntax inside jsx/tsx files, so it will complain about that. Solution: rename `.js` files to `.jsx` :)


## Before you Begin ðŸ›  ðŸ”¨

```
$ npm install
$ npm run dev
```

```
$ pnpm install
$ pnpm run dev
```

Head over to https://vitejs.dev/ to learn more about using vite

## For cloning the project ðŸª›

```
# Clone this repository
$ gh repo clone MastooraTurkmen/React-Project

# Go inside the repository
$ cd react-project
```
